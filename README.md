# Diamond Price Prediction

This project is about predicting the price of diamonds based on various features. We use the gemstone dataset and apply different machine learning models to find the one that gives us the highest accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Airflow:** Used for scheduling and automating the data pipeline tasks.
- **MLflow:** Used for managing the machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.
- **Flask:** Used to create a web application to serve our predictions.
- **Docker:** Used to containerize the application and its dependencies for easy deployment and scaling.

## Models Used

We experimented with various machine learning models. The model that gave us the highest accuracy is Lasso.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Docker and Docker Compose on your machine.
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the application.
4. Access the Flask application at the configured port.
